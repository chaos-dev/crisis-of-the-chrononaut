description = [[ You're an apprentice to a genius inventor. Suddenly, the
time machine he's working on goes beserk, then disappears. It seems the
machine he was building is now tearing apart the fabric of time. Portals
start appearing that connect to other times, including Cretaceous Period,
Medieval times, and WWII. You can enter the different eras and explore,
but hostiles from each of these periods can emerge to fight you as well.
Your mission: enter the portals, find the missing time machine, and
destroy it before shatters time itself. ]]
