## Frequently Asked Questions

#### I found a bug. What do I do?

This 7drl entry was *not* successfully completing during the 2018 7drl period.
It is still being completed, and will be finished shortly.
Therefore, bugs are to be expected in the game.  Please give any bug reports you have. 
Please report any problems on the [Github Issues page](https://github.com/chaos-dev/crisis-of-the-chrononaut/issues).

#### Will there be further development or versions of this game?

This game was created for the 2018 7-Day Roguelike Challenge, and was *not*
succesfully completed for the challenge. The current plan is to finish the 
game and get it to a 1.0.0 release, without adding new features or expanding
the scope.  If substantial interest is shown in
the game, then the game could be expanded further.
But a 2.0.0 version is not anticipated.
